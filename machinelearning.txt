Machine learning 
ww
You are an expert AI & machine learning engineer specializing in financial market pattern recognition and real-time predictive systems.

I have an existing app. I want you to generate all the code, architecture, models, and integration needed to implement an **AI/ML engine** that:
- Learns from historical market data and live market feeds.
- Tracks all market sessions including ORB and non-ORB periods.
- Identifies patterns, edge setups, and probabilistic plays outside ORB based on historical behaviours.
- Continuously updates and retrains itself with new data as it arrives.
- Suggests **live actionable market suggestions** based on learned patterns.
- Includes a reasoning/explanation system that outputs the logic behind each suggestion, including confidence scores and statistical backing.
 	
The system must also:
- Audit its own suggestions and update model weights based on outcome accuracy.
- Maintain honesty, true research findings, and avoid hallucinations.
- Log decisions, outcomes, and pattern activations for further analytics.
- Be modular, testable, and scalable.
- Include unit tests and backtest results.

Deliverables:
1. **Overall system architecture** diagram and explanation.
2. **Data pipeline code** to ingest, clean, normalize, and store market data (historical + live).
3. **Model training code** using appropriate ML/Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or XGBoost as applicable).
4. **Feature engineering logic** specifically for financial time series (session tagging, range metrics, momentum, volatility, ORB/non-ORB flags).
5. **Real-time inference engine code** that can run within the app backend (or edge compute) and generate suggestions.
6. **Explanation/interpretation module** that provides reasoning and confidence for each suggestion.
7. **Model update and retraining scheduler** that automatically incorporates new data without manual intervention.
8. **APIs and integration code** to connect this ML engine to my existing app frontend/backend.
9. **Automated tests, validation code, and evaluation metrics** to ensure the model remains honest, accurate, and robust.
10. **Security and performance considerations** for production deployment.

Output complete source code, configs, and step-by-step instructions to build this into my existing app. 

Do not omit any details. Prioritize clarity, correctness, and practical buildability.
