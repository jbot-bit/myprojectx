Here is a **clean, strict prompt** you can paste straight into Claude.

Read it once.
If approved, I can refine or add guardrails next.

### 📌 **CLAUDE ANALYSIS PROMPT — GAP CONTINUATION STRATEGY**

**Objective**
Identify whether **price gaps after a market closure** produce a **repeatable continuation edge** with:

* defined entry
* defined stop
* defined TP
* zero lookahead
* statistically valid expectancy

This is **research only**. No assumptions. No narrative bias.

---

### 1️⃣ Define “Gap” (do not assume)

You must **explicitly test multiple gap definitions**, including but not limited to:

* **Time-based gaps**

  * 30m, 60m, 90m, overnight
* **Session gaps**

  * Asia open
  * London open
  * NY open
  * Post-holiday reopen
  * Weekend reopen
* **Structural gaps**

  * Open price outside previous N-minute range
  * Open price beyond prior session high/low
* **ATR-normalised gaps**

  * Gap size as % of ATR(20)

Each gap type must be **tagged separately**.

---

### 2️⃣ Entry logic (must be mechanical)

For each gap type, test **multiple entry models**, e.g.:

* Immediate market continuation
* First pullback continuation
* ORB-style confirmation
* N-minute close acceptance beyond gap
* Retest + continuation

No discretionary logic.
All entries must be rule-based.

---

### 3️⃣ Stop logic (must be fixed & known at entry)

Test stops such as:

* Gap midpoint
* Gap origin
* Opposite side of prior range
* Fixed % of gap size
* Fixed % of ATR

Stop must be **known at entry** and **never adaptive**.

---

### 4️⃣ Take profit logic

Test **multiple TP models**, including:

* Fixed R multiples (0.5R, 1R, 1.5R, 2R, 3R)
* Gap-measured move
* Prior session range projection
* Time-based exit (fail-safe)

Track **MAE / MFE**.

---

### 5️⃣ Filters (explicitly optional)

Test with and without filters such as:

* Day of week
* Holiday vs normal day
* Prior session trend
* Volatility regime (ATR quartiles)
* Asia / London / NY session context

Filters must be **additive**, not baked in.

---

### 6️⃣ Validation rules (MANDATORY)

* Zero lookahead
* Time-split IS / OOS
* Robustness across thresholds
* Reject if:

  * Edge disappears with small parameter changes
  * Sample size < minimum statistical relevance
* No curve fitting

---

### 7️⃣ Output required (no fluff)

Claude must output:

* Exact ruleset(s) that survive validation
* Entry / stop / TP clearly defined
* Win rate, avg R, expectancy
* Trade frequency
* Regime where it **works**
* Regime where it **fails**
* Clear **GO / NO-GO** verdict

If no edge exists, say so.

---

### 8️⃣ Explicit exclusions

Do **NOT**:

* Reuse ORB logic unless justified
* Assume gaps must fill
* Assume continuation without stats
* Mix session labels not known at entry

---

### Final instruction

> Treat this as **edge discovery**, not strategy storytelling.
> If the data does not support it, reject it.

---

**Confirm:**

* Do you want this scoped to **MGC only** first, or **all instruments**?
