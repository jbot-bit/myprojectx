You are Claude Code inside my repo. I want you to find “massive NQ trades” that are REPEATABLE, not just mean-reversion scalps.

DEFINITION OF MASSIVE
- A “massive trade” is: [CHOOSE ONE: A) >=3R same-day runner, B) >=5R EOD capture, C) >=4R multi-leg]
- R must be defined from entry->stop (NOT from ORB boundary unless explicitly stated).
- Must be tradable with known info at decision time (no lookahead).

HARD HONESTY RULES
- No lookahead in features/signals.
- Conservative execution:
  - entry on next bar after signal
  - same-bar TP+SL => LOSS
  - slippage sensitivity: 0/1/2 ticks
- Outlier dependence test:
  - remove top 1% best days and re-evaluate expectancy
- Must pass time-split robustness:
  - IS: first 70% of dates, OOS: last 30%
  - Candidate must be profitable in BOTH (or reject).
- Must be stable in a small parameter neighborhood (not a single lucky threshold).

SEARCH SCOPE (DO NOT START WITH STRICT FILTERS)
- Search window: 16:00–21:00 and 23:00–02:00 (UTC+10) for big-move days.
- Use existing bars_1m_nq and daily_features_v2_nq.
- Generate candidate families broadly, then narrow only after evidence.

CANDIDATE FAMILIES TO TEST (FOR BIG MOVES)
1) “Trend day detector → hold runner”
   - early impulse + no deep pullback structure
2) “Breakout + retest continuation”
   - break a key level (prior day H/L, Asia H/L, pre-open range, ORB high/low) then retest then go
3) “Opening drive continuation”
   - first 15–30 min directional efficiency / range expansion
4) “Compression → expansion”
   - low range into a time window, then expansion with follow-through
5) “Sweep → continuation” (not sweep → fade)
   - sweep a reference level then continue in sweep direction

FEATURES ALLOWED (ONLY IF KNOWN BY DECISION TIME)
- rolling ATR/volatility up to t
- pre-window travel and compression metrics
- distance to prior day levels
- session highs/lows computed only up to current time
- simple momentum measures (consecutive closes, ROC)

DELIVERABLES
- Create: scripts/research_nq_massive_moves.py
- Outputs:
  - outputs/NQ_MASSIVE_CANDIDATES.csv (ranked)
  - outputs/NQ_MASSIVE_REPORT.md (definitions + robustness results)
- For each candidate include:
  - exact signal definition
  - entry/stop/target/timeout
  - trades, winrate, avgR, medianR, 75th percentile R
  - IS/OOS stats
  - slippage sensitivity
  - outlier-removed stats
  - “PASS/FAIL” decision

START NOW
1) Inspect schema to confirm tables.
2) Implement script.
3) Run it and write outputs.
If nothing passes, say so and report the best “almost passes” + why they fail.
