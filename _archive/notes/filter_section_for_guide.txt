## 23. ORB SIZE FILTERS (NEW - 2026-01-13)

### What Are ORB Size Filters?

**Filters that skip trades when the ORB is too large relative to recent volatility (ATR).**

### Why Filter Large ORBs?

**Pattern discovered:** Large ORB + Breakout = Exhaustion (chasing)
- Small ORB = Compression = Real breakout energy
- Large ORB = Expansion = Already moved, false breakout likely

### Which ORBs Have Filters?

| ORB | Filter | What It Means |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| 23:00 | Skip if ORB > 15.5% of ATR | Only trade compressed ORBs |
| 00:30 | Skip if ORB > 11.2% of ATR | Only trade compressed ORBs |
| 11:00 | Skip if ORB > 9.5% of ATR | Only trade compressed ORBs |
| 10:00 | Skip if ORB > 8.8% of ATR | Only trade compressed ORBs |
| 09:00 | No filter | Trade all ORBs |
| 18:00 | No filter (yet) | Trade all ORBs |

### Visual Example: 23:00 ORB Filter

**SCENARIO 1: SMALL ORB (PASS FILTER)**
```
ATR(20) = 10.0 points
ORB size = 1.2 points
ORB size / ATR = 1.2 / 10.0 = 0.12 (12%)

Filter threshold = 0.155 (15.5%)
Result: 12% < 15.5% → PASS → TRADE THIS ORB

Why: Compressed range, genuine breakout likely
```

**SCENARIO 2: LARGE ORB (REJECT)**
```
ATR(20) = 10.0 points
ORB size = 2.5 points
ORB size / ATR = 2.5 / 10.0 = 0.25 (25%)

Filter threshold = 0.155 (15.5%)
Result: 25% > 15.5% → REJECT → SKIP THIS ORB

Why: Already expanded, chasing, false breakout likely
```

### What You'll See in the App

**When filter is ACTIVE:**
- Status: "ORB TOO LARGE - FILTER REJECTED"
- Reason: "ORB size 2.5pts (25% of ATR) > threshold 15.5%"
- Action: "Stand down - wait for next ORB"

**When filter PASSES:**
- Normal ORB strategy display
- Breakout signals work as usual
- Filter operates silently in background

### Impact on Trading

**Trade Frequency:**
- 23:00: 36% of trades kept (64% filtered out)
- 00:30: 13% of trades kept (87% filtered out)
- 11:00: 11% of trades kept (89% filtered out)
- 10:00: 42% of trades kept (58% filtered out)

**Expected Monthly Trades:**
- **Before filters:** ~90 trades/month (all ORBs)
- **After filters:** ~25 trades/month (filtered ORBs)
- **Reduction:** 71.5% fewer trades

**Performance Improvement:**
- **Before filters:** +0.352R average per trade
- **After filters:** +0.510R average per trade
- **Improvement:** +0.158R per trade (+44.9%)

### Key Points

1. **Automatic:** Filters apply automatically in live trading
2. **No lookahead:** Filter uses only historical data (ATR) and ORB size known before entry
3. **Verified:** Manual calculation confirms all improvements
4. **Robust:** Works across different threshold values (not curve-fit)
5. **Trade-off:** Fewer trades but higher quality

### When to Override Filters (NEVER)

**Do NOT manually override filters.** They are based on 500+ trades of verified data.

If you think a filtered trade "looks good", remember:
- The filter exists because large ORBs statistically underperform
- Your discretion cannot outperform statistical edge
- Trust the system

### Monitoring Filters

**Track these metrics:**
1. Filter rejection rate (expect 58-89% depending on ORB)
2. Performance of trades that pass filter
3. Performance of trades that fail filter (if tracked separately)

**Monthly review:**
- Are rejection rates as expected?
- Is filtered performance maintaining edge?
- Any regime changes requiring threshold adjustment?
