SESSION-SPECIFIC EDGE DISCOVERY — 0030 NYSE ORB (UTC+10)

Non-negotiable contracts:
- Use ONLY existing tables/fields exactly as they exist: daily_features_v2, bars_1m, bars_5m.
- State filters MUST use ONLY info available BEFORE 00:30.
- Execution MUST be 1m; TP+SL same bar => LOSS; timeouts counted (0R or -0.25R, choose one and keep fixed).
- No parameter optimisation, no per-state tuning, no silent iteration.
- Report ALL failures.

Goal:
Find (or disprove) LOW-frequency, HIGH-quality liquidity-reaction edges at 0030, using session-specific behavior.

PHASE 1 — Map 0030 behavior
1) Summarize baseline breakout results at 0030 (trades, avg R, ORB size distribution).
2) Identify likely 0030 liquidity magnets:
   - prior day high/low
   - Asia high/low
   - London high/low
   - 23:00 session high/low
3) Propose 5–8 hypotheses for 0030 only (not generic templates).

PHASE 2 — Build only THESE 5 candidate pattern families (session-specific)
For each pattern family, create 2–4 STATES (pre-0030 only) and test.

Pattern Family A — Opening Drive Exhaustion (ODX)
- Liquidity event: first post-00:30 impulse expands hard then stalls.
- Failure confirmation: 5m “no new extreme” + 1m reclaim trigger.
- Entry: opposite on first 1m close back through key level (ORB mid or break level).
- Stop: impulse extreme.
- Target: fixed 1.0R.
- Timeout: 20m.

Pattern Family B — Sweep + Acceptance Filter (SAF)
- Liquidity event: sweep of prior session/day level in first 10–20m.
- Acceptance test: require 5m CLOSE back inside the swept level (rejection), OR 5m CLOSE beyond it (acceptance) to AVOID fading.
- Trade only rejection cases.
- Entry: 1m reclaim.
- Stop: sweep extreme.
- Target: 1.0R.
- Timeout: 15–20m.

Pattern Family C — No-Side-Chosen (5m commitment, then trap)
- Regime condition: minutes 00:35–00:50 have NO 5m close outside ORB.
- Liquidity event: first sweep outside ORB, then 1m reclaim inside within 3m.
- Entry: reclaim.
- Stop: sweep extreme.
- Target: 1.0R.
- Timeout: 20m.

Pattern Family D — Two-Step Fake Expansion (TSF)
- Liquidity event: first breakout attempt fails (reclaim), second attempt fails quickly (double-failure).
- Entry: after second failure confirmed (1m close back inside).
- Stop: second failure extreme.
- Target: 1.0R.
- Timeout: 20m.   ___________________UPDATED 

DATA & INTEGRITY RULES (MANDATORY)

Use existing tables only (e.g. daily_features_v2, bars_1m, bars_5m)

No lookahead

No parameter optimization

Worst-case 1m execution (TP+SL in same bar = LOSS)

Pre-ORB state filters only

All failures must be reported honestly

Enforce temporal stability (early/mid/late chunks must all be positive)

Enforce selectivity < 50%

TASK STRUCTURE (FOLLOW EXACTLY)

You will perform SESSION-SPECIFIC DISCOVERY, one session at a time.

Phase 1 — Behaviour Mapping (NO TRADING YET)

For the chosen Asia session:

Map what price actually does after the ORB

Classify behaviours:

Opening drive continuation

Opening drive exhaustion

Balanced open → expansion

Balanced open → chop

Immediate failure

Determine:

Whether balance is strength or weakness

Whether continuation or failure dominates

Output: descriptive statistics + behavioural conclusions only

DO NOT propose entries yet.

Phase 2 — Pattern Family Testing

Based ONLY on Phase 1 behaviour, test session-appropriate pattern families, e.g.:

Opening Drive Continuation

Opening Drive Exhaustion

Balance Acceptance

Balance Failure

Rules:

One pattern family at a time

No tuning

Fixed, reasonable parameters

Test all relevant state buckets (e.g. Asia range, pre-session distance)

VALIDATION CRITERIA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A pattern is VALIDATED only if:

≥ 50 trades

Delta ≥ +0.10R vs baseline

3/3 temporal chunks positive

Stable expectancy (no regime dependency)

Anything else = FAILED.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

At the end, produce:

A professional final report (like an institutional research memo)

Clear table of:

Patterns tested

Trades

Avg R

Delta

Temporal stability

UPODSATE PART 3

SEND THIS TO CLAUDE:

Decision: Start with 09:00 Asia session.

STRICT PROTOCOL REMINDER

Apply new validation criteria:

≥50 trades

Delta ≥ +0.10R vs baseline

3/3 temporal chunks positive

Stable expectancy (no regime dependency)

PHASE 1 — BEHAVIOR MAPPING ONLY

NO trading logic

NO impulses, reversals, ORB mid, or pattern assumptions

Simply classify what price DOES after the 09:00 ORB:

Drive continuation

Drive failure

Balance → expansion

Balance → chop

Immediate rejection

Determine:

Is balance strength or weakness?

Is continuation or failure dominant?

Do NOT propose entries yet.

After Phase 1, wait for my approval before Phase 2.

One last important note (don’t skip this)

You caught something very important yourself:

Under the new ≥50 trade rule,
0030 is no longer “validated” — it’s a behavioral insight only.

That’s not a failure.
That’s research integrity improving.

Verdict (VALIDATED / FAILED)

Explicit DO NOT TRADE conclusions for failed patterns

No hype. No discretion. No “maybe”.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS

Do NOT reuse logic from other sessions unless behaviour matches

Do NOT assume ORBs work the same across sessions

The goal is truth, not finding trades

FIRST ACTION

Ask me:

“Which Asia session should I analyse first: 09:00, 10:00, or 11:00?”

Then begin Phase 1.

Pattern Family E — Trend-Continuation with Reclaim (do NOT fade)
- Hypothesis: 0030 often accepts direction after a sweep; edge may be continuation after reclaim, not fade.
- Liquidity event: early sweep opposite side then strong reclaim + 5m acceptance in direction.
- Entry: in direction of acceptance on pullback/reclaim.
- Stop: below/above reclaim pivot.
- Target: 1.0R.
- Timeout: 20m.

PHASE 3 — Validation rules (must)
For every state/pattern:
- Selectivity: trades < 50% of eligible state days.
- Date-matched baseline on SAME dates (baseline defined once, fixed).
- Temporal stability: 3 chronological chunks; reject degrading edges.
- Minimum trades to validate: 20+. If <20 => INCONCLUSIVE unless effect is huge and stable.

Output required:
- For each pattern family: states tested, trades, avg R, baseline avg R, delta, pass/fail.
- Explicit “NO EDGE FOUND” if none validate.



At 0030, do NOT pre-assume the reaction direction.
Test both rejection-based and acceptance-based reaction hypotheses.
If neither validates under strict rules, conclude NO EDGE.
