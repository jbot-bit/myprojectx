# Decision-Focused Trading App - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: January 16, 2026
**File**: `trading_app_decision_focused.py`
**Status**: Ready to use!

---

## What's Different? WAY BETTER!

### OLD APP Problems:
- ❌ Too much information, hard to decide
- ❌ All ORBs shown equally (no prioritization)
- ❌ No clear "what to do NOW"
- ❌ Hidden in tabs
- ❌ No countdown timers
- ❌ No clear action guidance

### NEW APP Solutions:
- ✅ **Shows ACTIVE ORBs first** (huge, can't miss)
- ✅ **SOON ORBs next** (< 60 min - get ready!)
- ✅ **Clear countdowns** ("in 15 min", "in 2h 30m")
- ✅ **Color-coded by tier** (S+ = red, S = orange, A = green)
- ✅ **Action-oriented** ("GO!", "WAIT", "SET ALERTS")
- ✅ **Risk guidance by tier** (tells you how much to risk)
- ✅ **One screen** - no tabs to get lost in

- **SOON**: < 60 minutes away
- **UPCOMING**: > 60 minutes away
- **PASSED**: Already happened today

### Filter Checking:
- Automatic ORB size vs ATR check
- Clear PASS/FAIL with percentages
- Warning to skip if fails
- Explains why filter matters

### Position Sizing:
- Account-aware (you input size)
