## POST-ENTRY MANAGEMENT

**Phase 1: Breakeven (0-10 minutes)**:

- [ ] If not +1R in 10 min → Keep original stop

**Phase 2: Structure Trail (15+ minutes)**:
- [ ] SHORT: Trail stop behind lower highs (pivot highs that are lower)
- [ ] LONG: Trail stop behind higher lows (pivot lows that are higher)

**Time Limit**:
- [ ] 90 minutes max hold from entry
- [ ] DO NOT exit at fixed time (15/30/60min) - destroys edge!

## CRITICAL RULES (NEVER BREAK)

❌ **If gap <9.5pts → NO TRADE** (edge requires large gaps)
❌ **If no acceptance failure → NO TRADE** (must confirm trapped participants)
❌ **If entry not at level → NO TRADE** (must be within 0.1pts)
❌ **If risk >0.25% account → REDUCE SIZE** (survival > profit)
✅ **If all conditions met → EXECUTE** (don't hesitate, edge is proven)

## POSITION SIZE CALCULATOR

**Account**: $__________
**Max Risk**: 0.25% = $__________
**Trade Risk**: ________ pts × $10/pt = $________ per contract
**Max Contracts**: (Max Risk $) / (Trade Risk $) = ________

**Example**:
- Account: $100,000
- Max Risk: 0.25% = $250
- Trade Risk: 1.5pts × $10 = $15 per contract
- Max Contracts: $250 / $15 = **16 contracts**

## EXPECTATIONS (Remember These When Losing)

- **Win Rate**: 19-27% (you will lose 70%+ of trades)
- **Median**: -1R (most trades are losers)
- **Frequency**: 2-3 setups per month
- **Max Losing Streak**: 14 consecutive (tested)
- **Edge Source**: Tail events (+10R to +129R occasional trades)

**Your Job**: Survive losses, capture tail events

## QUICK MENTAL CHECKS

**Before Entry**:
- "Is gap >9.5pts?" → If NO, stop
- "Did price close back through within 3 bars?" → If NO, stop
- "Is my risk 0.10-0.25%?" → If NO, reduce size

**During Trade**:
- "Am I at +1R within 10min?" → If YES, move to BE
- "Has 15min passed?" → If YES, start trailing structure
- "Am I tempted to take profit early?" → If YES, remember: early exit = -1.78R

**After Trade**:
- "Did I follow all 6 rules?" → YES = good execution
- "Was this a large gap?" → Track for quarterly review
- "How many consecutive losses?" → Update streak counter
