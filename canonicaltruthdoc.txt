You are acting as a PROJECT AUDITOR, not a coder.

Your first job is to UNDERSTAND the project before proposing any changes.

STRICT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- DO NOT create new apps, files, folders, or scripts.
- DO NOT refactor or move anything yet.
- DO NOT invent structure or assume intent.
- DO NOT optimise or “improve” code.
- DO NOT duplicate logic.
- ONE source of truth only.

If you break any of these rules, stop and say: “RULE VIOLATION”.

--------------------------------
PHASE 1 — FULL INVENTORY (READ-ONLY)
--------------------------------
Scan the entire project and produce a structured inventory:

1. APPS
   - List every app / UI / entry point
   - For each:
     - filename
     - purpose (what it actually does, not what it claims)
     - overlaps with other apps

2. DATA SOURCES
   - List all databases, CSVs, APIs, generated tables
   - Identify:
     - which are primary vs derived
     - where each is read
     - where each is written
     - any duplication or shadow copies

3. SCHEMAS & FEATURES
   - List all schema definitions (tables, views, feature builders)
   - Identify:
     - canonical schema
     - derived / duplicated schemas
     - inconsistencies in naming or meaning

4. RULES / LOGIC
   - Identify where trading rules actually live
   - List every document or file that claims to define rules
   - Identify conflicts, drift, or duplicates

5. DOCUMENTATION
   - List all markdown/docs
   - Classify each as:
     - canonical
     - derivative
     - obsolete
     - generated summary

6. EXECUTION FLOW
   - Trace the real flow:
     data → features → backtest → app → live logic
   - Call out any mismatches or forks

DO NOT suggest fixes yet.
Output only the inventory.

--------------------------------
PHASE 2 — SOURCE OF TRUTH DECISION
--------------------------------
Based ONLY on the inventory, propose:

1. ONE canonical source of truth for:
   - trading rules
   - schemas
   - data generation
   - execution logic

2. A clear list of:
   - files that should be canonical
   - files that are duplicates
   - files that are generated artifacts
   - files that should be archived (not deleted)

NO MOVES YET.
NO FILE CREATION.

--------------------------------
PHASE 3 — CLEANUP PLAN (PROPOSAL ONLY)
--------------------------------
Propose a minimal, reversible cleanup plan:

- Exact files to archive
- Exact files to keep
- Exact files to merge INTO the canonical source
- Exact rules to prevent future duplication

Constraints:
- Zero logic changes
- Zero behavior changes
- Zero schema changes
- Zero new files

--------------------------------
PHASE 4 — SAFETY CHECK
--------------------------------
Before finishing, answer:
- What would break if this plan is wrong?
- What assumptions could be false?
- What MUST be confirmed by the human before any action?

--------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------
Use this structure ONLY:

1. INVENTORY
2. CANONICAL SOURCES
3. DUPLICATES / GENERATED FILES
4. PROPOSED CLEANUP (NO ACTIONS)
5. RISKS & CONFIRMATIONS

WAIT FOR HUMAN CONFIRMATION.
DO NOT ACT.
